Abstract
In many ecosystems, fire is a key element that shapes the structure and functioning of many ecosystems. Likewise, many plant species have managed to develop some characteristics that allow them to survive fires, such as changes in their biochemistry and rapid loss and gain of biomass. Biomass is an important metric as the presence of high values can lead to more intense fires. Thus, we evaluated the percentage of biomass consumed by fire of two species of plants, _Pinus patula_ and _Baccharis conferta_, which are distributed throughout the Cofre de Perote, Veracruz, Mexico. We found that the biomass values consumed by _P. patula_ are lower compared to _B. conferta_, this is because although it is not a species that is resistant to fire, its reaction time is shorter than _B. conferta_. Likewise, it has been documented that _B. conferta_ is a species that is generally found in burned areas where there were fire events, however, little is known about its relation to fire.

KEYWORDS: adaptations, characteristics, dependency, wildfire.
